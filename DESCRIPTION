Description: 
    referenceSearch is an R package that provides an interface for creating a
    searchable Solr index from a dataframe of records, as well as searching against
    that index with a dataframe of parsed citations. It was designed to allow
    searching citations against record metadata that is not contained in common
    citation indexes, e.g government grey literature.
